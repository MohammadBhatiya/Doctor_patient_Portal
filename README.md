This Doctor's Appointment is in PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. 
The Docter Appointment In PHP is a simple project developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project contains admin and user sides. The admin side manages all the management like adding and deleting doctors’ records, viewing patient records, and appointments.

For the user section, the users can either be a patient or a doctor. The user can log in as a doctor, and check their appointment, patients, timings, and so on. Similarly, to log in as a patient, the user should have their login id and password for this hospital. If the patient doesn’t have them, they can first register as a new patient. The patient can make their appointments, prescription records, treatment records, and so on.
